Layers: Modular type class machinery for monad transformer stacks (mtl edition)
==================================================================

This repository is a fork of [duairc/layers](duairc/layers).
Its purpose is to update the library to a modern Haskell version (the latest commit in the original repository is from six years ago), and to transpose its approach to _mtl_ .

This work is still very much a work in progress and is going on in the `mtl` branch.
