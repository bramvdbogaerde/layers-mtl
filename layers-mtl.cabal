description:
  The @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers layers>@ package provides
  the type class machinery needed to make monads built out of
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadtransformerstack stacks> of
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadtransformer monad transformers>
  easy to use. The type class machinery provided and the design patterns
  suggested by @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers layers>@ allow for
  much more modularity than is possible with the existing type class machinery
  and design patterns. With
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers layers>@
  it is possible to use arbitrary
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadinterface monad interfaces>
  (<Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadinterface monad interfaces> are
  what we call the sort of type classes that you see in the
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl mtl>@
  and similar packages) with arbtirary
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadtransformer monad transformers>
  (by <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadtransformer monad transformers>
  here, we are specifically to
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadconstructor monad constructors>,
  such as the ones defined in
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers transformers>@), without
  ever having to explicitly define how to lift specific
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadinterface interfaces> through
  specific <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadtransformer transformers>.
  It also provides a more complete
  set of <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadinterface monad interfaces>
  than the @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl mtl>@, which fully solve
  the problems of exceptions and exception safety (among others), while
  maintaining full compatibility with all the
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadinterface monad interfaces> from the
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl mtl>@.
  .
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers layers>@ improves upon and/or
  replaces, in part or in whole, the following list of packages:
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl mtl>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmtl mmtl>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-base transformers-base>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-control monad-control>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-base lifted-base>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-peel monad-peel>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MonadCatchIO-transformers MonadCatchIO-transformers>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exceptions exceptions>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MonadCatchIO-mtl MonadCatchIO-mtl>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exception-transformers exception-transformers>@,
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-abort-fd monad-abort-fd>@ and
  probably more too. There have been many attempts to either improve upon or
  work around the deficiencies of the existing type class machinery for
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadtransformerstack monad transformer stacks>,
  but we believe
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers layers>@ is the most complete of
  any of these so far.
  .
  A comprehensive overview of the motivation behind
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers layers>@ and an explanation of
  the design decisions taken is given in "Documentation.Layers.Overview". It
  is /highly recommended/ that you read this if you are considering using this
  package. A detailed glossary of the jargon used throughout the documentation
  of this package is given in "Documentation.Layers.Glossary". The core type
  classes used by the package are exported from "Control.Monad.Lift" (some of
  these originate in
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers transformers>@ and
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmorph mmorph>@). The rest of the
  modules in this package export
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadinterface monad interfaces>, in the
  <doc-index-M.html Monad.*> hierarchy, including replacements for all of the
  <Documentation-Layers-Glossary.html#monadinterface monad interfaces> of the
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl mtl>@ package.
